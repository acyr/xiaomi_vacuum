# ðŸš§This Repo is no longer mainainedðŸš§
Sadly, my Dreame D9 died a long time ago.

I thought about adding support for my new device into this project, but after some consideration I think it's better to collaborate on other projects like python-miio instead of (almost completely) rewriting this repository to have multi device support.

For the time being this repository should work until HA changes something.

# xiaomi_vacuum (Dreame D9) integration for Homeassistant

A custom component for Dreame Vacuum Robot D9 (dreame.vacuum.p2009) with support for features such as consumables' lifespan, water level, room and zone cleaning, etc.  
This integration should also work for the following models:

- Dreame Vacuum Robot F9 (dreame.vacuum.p2008)
- Dreame Vacuum Robot L10 Pro (dreame.vacuum.p2029)
- MOVA L600 Vacuum Robot (dreame.vacuum.p2157)

## Room cleaning support

To use single room cleaning features (marked with <sup>1</sup> ), you need to create a schedule in `MiHome` app, which you can disable (but do not remove).  
Select the rooms you want to be displayed in HA.  
Do not choose `All` when creating the cleaning schedule.  
Select rooms one by one, and afterwards this integration can get a list of your rooms.  
If you have multiple maps create a schedule for each map. Afterwards you can also switch between the maps using this integration's `select_map` service

### Example of cleaning schedule:

In the following examples the selected rooms will show up in the same order. Other information, like time, speed, etc. is irrelevant.  
![Example Schedule](docs/schedule-example.jpg)

The resulting Homeassistant room list attribute:

```yaml
room_list:
  map_0:
    - B
    - E
    - D
    - C
    - A
```

Which means:

- B &#8594; Bedroom
- E &#8594; Living Room
- D &#8594; Office
- C &#8594; Corridor
- A &#8594; Kitchen

### Example of calling room cleaning service:

After the above step is done, room cleaning service can be called.

For example Cleaning the kitchen with `Two` passes, `Turbo` fan speed, and `High` water leve.

As action in `vacuum-cardÂ´:

```yaml
---
- name: Clean Kitchen
  icon: svg:kitchen
  service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_clean_room_by_id
  service_data:
    entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
    rooms:
      - A
    repeats: 2
    clean_mode: 4
    mop_mode: 3
```

As service call:

```yaml
- service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_clean_room_by_id
  data:
    entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
    rooms: ["A"]
    repeats: 2
    clean_mode: 4
    mop_mode: 3
```

It is also possible to specify the number of cleaning passes, fan speed, and water level for each room independently:

```yaml
  - service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_clean_room_by_id
    data:
      entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
      rooms: [[ 'A', 2, 4, 3], [ 'B', 1, 2, 3]]
      repeats: 2  >>> this will get ignored if per room repeats is specified
      clean_mode: 2. >>> this will get ignored if per room clean_mode is specified
      mop_mode: 2 >>> this will get ignored if per room mop_mode is specified
```

## Installing custom voice packs

It is possible to install custom voice packs using `vacuum_install_voice_pack` service.  
As a template for creating your own voice pack you can use the official packages:

- [Dreame D9 official voice packages](https://awsde0.fds.api.xiaomi.com/dreame-product/dreame.vacuum.p2009/voices/soundpackage.json)
- [Dreame F9 official voice packages](https://awsde0.fds.api.xiaomi.com/dreame-product/dreame.vacuum.p2008/voices/soundpackage.json)
- [Dreame L10 Pro official voice packages](https://awsde0.fds.api.xiaomi.com/dreame-product/dreame.vacuum.p2029/voices/soundpackage.json)

### Example of install voice pack

The following service call will install my voice pack named `en-azure.tar.gz` that I hosted localy on my development machine.  
Note: the default English pack with the `lang_id` of `EN` cannot be overwritten. You can use something else like `US` instead of `EN`.

```yaml
service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_install_voice_pack
data:
  entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
  lang_id: US
  url: http://192.168.31.176/en-azure.tar.gz
  md5: afee12651d96d26be46d898f647e8f0f
  size: 2532057
```

## Remote controlling the robot

It is also possible to remotely move the robot forward, backward or rotate it using `vacuum_remote_control_move_step` service.
This service requires the following attributes:

- velosity: the speed in which the robot moves. Positive values indicate a forward movement and negative values, backward. The value must be between 100 and -300.
- rotation: the angle of rotation in binary degrees. Positive Values indicate a CCW rotation and negative values, CW. The value must be between 128 and -128.

### Examples of calling remote control step service

Rotating the bot 45Â° CCW

```yaml
service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_remote_control_move_step
data:
  entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
  rotation: 64
  velocity: 0
```

moving forward and turning 45Â° CW at the same time

```yaml
service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_remote_control_move_step
data:
  entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
  rotation: -64
  velocity: 100
```

## Defining virtual walls, no go zones, and no mop zones.

In order to create or remove virtual walls, no go zones, and/or no mop zones the `vacuum_set_restricted_zone` service can be used.

This service accepts the following parameters, they all have the same format [x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>].

- walls: Virtual walls coordinates.
- zones: No go zones coordinates.
- mops: No mop zones coordinates.

To remove all any of the three kind of restrictions leave it's field empty.

### Examples of virtual walls and no go zones

To only have two virtual walls and one no mop zones

```yaml
service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_set_restricted_zone
data:
  entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
  walls: "[819,-263,4424,2105],[-2001,-3050,-542,515]"
  zones: ""
  mops: "[3415,-967,3915,80]"
```

To remove every restriction:

```yaml
service: xiaomi_vacuum.vacuum_set_restricted_zone
data:
  entity_id: vacuum.dreame_d9
  walls: ""
  zones: ""
  mops: ""
```

## Developement Status

I tried to expose as many of the device's properties as possible, in case someone wants to use them in their scripts, automations, etc.
Almost all of the services have proper selector definitions, so that it is possible to use the UI editor.
A complete list of supported attributes and services can be found here:
[Complete List of Attributes and Services](./docs/attributes&services.md)

## Installation

Two possibilities for installation :

- Manually : add the "xiaomi_vacuum" folder to the /config/custom_components folder ; reboot
- With HACS : go in HACS, click on Integrations, click on the three little dots at top of the screen and selection "custom repositories", add this github url, select "Integration" as repository, and click ADD. Then go to the Integrations tab of HACS, and install the "Dreame Vacuum Robot D9" integration.

Code to add to configuration.yaml :

```
vacuum:
  - platform: xiaomi_vacuum
    host: <ip>
    token: "<token>"
    name: <name>
```

The optional configuration parameter `no_sleep_when_docked: true` can be added. In that case the status of the bot will not change to idle when it is docked. The bot will still go to sleep mode, but it's status will still show up as docked. `no_sleep_when_docked` is `false` by default.

To retrieve the token:

- If using the original firmware follow the default integration <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/vacuum.xiaomi_miio/#retrieving-the-access-token">instructions</a>.

- If you have a rooted vacuum you can read the token from the device. It is saved in the following file:
  ```bash
  /data/config/miio/device.token
  ```
  After reading the token from the file it should be converted to hex for example with the following command:
  ```
  echo -n <token> | xxd -p
  ```

## Lovelace Card

Any Lovelace card for vacuum devices should work but the functionality may vary as different cards have different implementation of things like water level.

One such card is [Vacuum Card](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card), which can be modified to show water level selection.

Here is an example:  
![Lovelace Card](docs/card.jpg)

Of course it can also be done by combining basic cards like entity rows and so on:
